**Thermal Dataset YOLOv8 Occupancy Sensing**

--This project focuses on automatic labeling and training preparation for thermal images used for occupancy detection(number of people).

--Images are organized by the number of people, labeled using thermal blob detection, and formatted for use with YOLOv8.

--Custom Dataset is collected  using Raspberry Pi and MLX9060 Thermal Camera Module.
