# **Thermal Dataset YOLOv8 Occupancy Sensing**

**This project focuses on automatic labeling and training preparation for thermal images used for occupancy detection(number of people).** 

#Images are organized by the number of people, labeled using thermal blob detection, and formatted for use with YOLOv8.

#Custom Dataset is collected  using Raspberry Pi and **MLX90640 **Thermal Camera Module. 
Preprocessed and annotated the data.
The model provides 99% accuracy.
I have also used A Blob Filtering Algorithm - ABFA, as mentioned in the paper : https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10041292
Example_1 :
Here We can Identify 3 People .
